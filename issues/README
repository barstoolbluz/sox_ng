Scripts to manage a forgejo repository's issues,
maintained at https://codeberg.org/sox_ng/issues

They can be run from the top directory as "sh issues/whatever.sh"
or in the "issues" directory. If there is an "issues" directory here,
the issues are downloaded into it instead of into the top directory.

getissues.sh
	Downloads the issues from forgejo.
	-O: Only download open issues.

putissues.sh
	Updates (replaces) the forgejo issues from this directory.
	Be careful!
	It has lots of options: putissues.sh --help to see them.

issues.sh
	The script that performs the actions of the above.

makehtml.sh
	Makes HTML files from the downloaded files
	and an index.html listing them.

clean.sh
	Removes files generated by makehtml.sh

	With -a it also removes issues whose .md files haven't been modified
	since they were downloaded.
	It knows this from the modification dates of the .md file and its
	corresponding directory so if you add something to an issue's metadata
	and don't want it removed by "./clean.sh -a",
	remember to touch the corresponding .md file afterwards.

	With -a -f it removes all downloaded issues. Caveat emptor.
