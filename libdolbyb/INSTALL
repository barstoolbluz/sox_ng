If you have downloaded a release tarball you should just need
"make" and a C compiler.

    make
    make install

If you have FreePascal (fpc) installed, you can compile the original Pascal:

    make DolbyBi64

If you downloaded the latest development version with

    git clone https://codeberg.org/martinwguy/libdolbyb
    cd libdolbyb

you'll also need to install autoconf, automake and libtool and

    autoreconf -i
    ./configure
    make
    make install

For a standalone executable that you can move and run without
having to install libdolbyb:

    ./configure --enable-static --disable-shared
    make clean
    make

for a "dolbyb" with libdolby linked inside it.
