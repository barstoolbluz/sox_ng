The libdolbyb project aims to translate dolbybcsoftwaredecode.sf.net
into C so that it can be used as a library in SoX_ng.
If it's useful to other open source programs, that is very welcome.

The C version produces exactly the same audio output as the
original Pascal version compiled on a 32-bit system;
the audio output of the Pascal version compiled on a 64-bit system
differs in a handful of places by one bit value from what you get
compiling it on a 32-bit system, presumably some problem with FreePascal,
but the differences are sure to be well below any noise floor or
the program's deviation from the ideal Dolby B response curves.

There is a mailing list libdolbyb@groups.io for discussion
and for announcements of new versions. To subscribe, go to
http://groups.io/g/libdolbyb or send an email to

The original source code has no copyright statement or licence
which makes it in the public domain.

The C version of the library is covered by the GNU Public Licence version 2.
Yes, GPL, not LGPL. If you want to include it in a commercial product,
you can either translate the original Pascal sources and make them work
or use FreePascal to compile the original library and link to it.

The name "dolbyb" is pronounced "DOLL bib" and is a new proper noun without
any implied reference to Dolby Laboratories Inc. with whom I have had
nothing to do except as a longtime user of their excellent products.

I have the original author's blessing for this work
